# 2D file explorer for VSCode

This is Work In Progress 2D file explorer for VSCode. It provides tree and dendrogram views of the workspace.

It was spawned because I find it hard to explore mono-repos in VSCode simply because the file explorer tree view gets crowded real quick.

## TODO
- [ ] Make nodes clickable
  - [ ] Expand/collapse folders
  - [ ] Reveal files in editor
  - [ ] Add context menu
- [ ] Allow configuring the extension
  - [ ] Auto expand settings:
    - [ ] Max depth
    - [ ] Max number of children (to avoid crowding)
  - [ ] .ignore config
- [ ] Maybe render editor within the tree view
- [ ] Add options to:
  - [ ] filter
  - [ ] search
  - [ ] sort
  - [ ] group
  - [ ] customize rendering
- [ ] Integrate with available language servers
- [ ] AI search because it's 2024
